I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by Ryan Tibshirani. Previously, I completed my PhD in Statistics in 2024 at Stanford University, where I was advised by Emmanuel Cand√®s. Before that, I obtained my BSc in Math and Computer Science at McGill. My research spans a variety of topics related to predictive inference, distribution-free uncertainty quantification, online learning, and high-dimensional statistics.
