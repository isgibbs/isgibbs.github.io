I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by Ryan Tibshirani. I completed my PhD in Statistics in 2024 at Stanford University, where I was advised by Emmanuel Cand√®s. Before that, I obtained my BSc in Math and Computer Science at McGill. My research develops new methods for quantifying and communicating the uncertainty underlying predictions made by black-box models. You can reach me at <code>igibbs@berkeley.edu</code>. A copy of my CV is available <a href="assets/IsaacGibbsCV.pdf"> here</a>.
