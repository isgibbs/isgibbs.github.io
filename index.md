    I am a fifth year PhD student in the Stanford Statistics Department advised by Emmanuel Cand&egraves. Previously, I completed a BSc in Math and Computer Science at McGill. My research develops new methods for quantifying the uncertainty underlying predictions made by black-box models (e.g. neural nets, random forests).
