    I am a fourth year PhD student in the Stanford Statistics Department advised by Emmanuel Cand&egraves. Previously, I completed a BSc in Math and Computer Science at McGill. My research focuses on developing new methods for quantifying the uncertainty of black-box prediction model (e.g. neural nets, random forests).
