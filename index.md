    I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley where I am advised by Ryan Tibshirani. I completed my PhD in Statistics in 2024 at Stanford University where I was advised by Emmanuel Cand&egraves. Before that, I obtained my BSc in Math and Computer Science at McGill. My research develops new methods for quantifying and communicating the uncertainty underlying predictions made by black-box models.
